# Data Products Assignment 4 - Shiny App

For the Data Products course Assignment 4, I have created a Shiny app that generates different visualizations 
of a Harmonograph using random parameters. The idea was originally developed and inspired by the following article
by user 'aschinchon' on R-bloggers:

The accompanying presentation (slides) for the assignment can be found here:

The app itself can be run here, hosted on shinyapps.io:
